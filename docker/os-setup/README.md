# Docker OS Setup

## Installation

- Install the [Docker client](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)

- Make sure you have the dependencies for syncing files via _Unison_:

  ```bash
  $ brew install unison
  $ brew install eugenmayer/dockersync/unox
  ```

  You now should be able to call `unison-fsmonitor` as an executable.

## The `dock` shortcut to run Docker commands
Install the shortcut below in your shell to shorten the syntax to run commands on your running `web` container.
Now, instead of:
```bash
$ docker exec -it myproject_web_1 [command]
```
You can run:
```bash
$ dock [command]
```
For instance:
```bash
$ dock ls
$ dock bash
$ dock g spawn
$ dock g snippet create
```



### Bash

For in your `~/.bash_profile`:
```bash
function dock {
    docker exec -it ${PWD##*/}_web_1 "$@"
}
```
### Fish shell
Add this function with `funced dock` and then save with `funcsave dock`.
```bash
function dock
    docker exec -it (basename $PWD)_web_1 $argv
end
```


## Add convenience hostname

- Optionally, you can add the Docker database host (we use `db` for convention) to your local nameserver, so you can address it with this name instead of an IP address.

  Add the following line to `/etc/hosts`:
  `127.0.0.1 db`
